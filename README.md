Indian Banking Transactions & ATM Forecasting (2016–2024)
This project combines transactional trend analysis and time series forecasting to map the evolution of Indian banking—from cash and ATMs to digital channels—using official RBI datasets.

Part 1: RBI Banking Transaction Patterns Analysis

Analyzed monthly data from 100+ banks to understand adoption of digital vs. cash-based channels.

Compared transaction trends across ATM, POS, e-commerce, micro-ATM, and QR payments.

Segmented findings across public, private, and regional rural banks.

Highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on user behavior and banking infrastructure.

Tracked adoption of UPI, QR, and e-commerce via growth curves and temporal patterns.

Used Fermi estimation to approximate market size shifts.

Summarized findings with clear graphs and tables.

Part 2: SBI ATM Time Series Forecasting

Focused on SBI’s on-site and off-site ATM deployment trends.

Explored trend, seasonality, and stationarity in ATM data.

Applied SARIMA, Holt-Winters, VAR, and VARIMA models to forecast 5 months ahead.

Benchmarked models using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate accuracy.

Powered entirely by RBI’s real monthly data—no assumptions, just data-backed insights.
